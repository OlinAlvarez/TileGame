Things still needed to finish Homework 3.

Gameplay needs:
Need to create the attack visual board.
General idea is how have a pokemon style attack board.

Make the power ups functional
make sure that each attack has a certain possibility of missing.

Strong attacks > 30 should have a 45% chance of missing
Medium attacks 30 > x >= 15, should have a 20% chance of missing
Weak attacks < 15, should have only a 3% chance of missing.

Display needs:
need to figure out a design for the grid.
Need to clear the page for monster battles.
possibly just take the attack grid idea from github
find somefiles for pictures of monsters. 
Maybe steal some from PokeMon lol.
